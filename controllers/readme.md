The below User Story was used to design the app:

A local running club has asked me to build a piece of software to help them to manage memberships, and register members for classes.

The minimum requirements:

- The app should allow the running club manager to create / edit / delete    members
- The app should allow the running club manager to create / edit / delete classes
- The app should allow the running club manager to add members to specific classes
- The app should show a list of all upcoming classes
- The app should show all members that are registered for a particular class

The app is running on http://localhost:4567 , to run type 'ruby app.rb' in console.
